# ðŸ“œ Touch

[Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/touchmarine/to) | [Playground](http://touchlabs.io/play) | [MIT License](LICENSE)

Touch is a lightweight markup language.
It uses puncutation characters to inscribe meaning to otherwise plain text.
The grammar is simple to parse, allowing for easy tooling.

Touch in a few bullet points:

- familiar syntaxâ€”follows existing conventions
- easily extensible via JSON for teams that need extra elements (removes the need for inline HTML or other flavors of the language)
- default config includes only common elements (including comments!) which should satisfy 80% of use cases
- comes with auto-formatting (think prettier or gofmt)
## Quick Start

Online playground: http://touchlabs.io/play

### Locally

1. Install the latest binary from [Releases](https://github.com/touchmarine/to/releases) or run ``go get github.com/touchmarine/to`` if you have Go installed.
1. Run ``to version`` to verify it&#39;s working.
1. Run ``to build html < file.to > file.html`` to convert Touch to HTML.
Use ``to help`` for details.

### Auto-Formatting

```bash
to fmt < file.to 1<> file.to                # 1<> to write to same file we read from
to fmt -linelength 80 < file.to 1<> file.to # hard-wrap at 80 columns
```

### Elements
